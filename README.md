### Hey Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luiz.

I'm 38 years young!

I'm on a journey of self-discovery through programming, constantly evolving and embracing new technologies. Currently, I'm at QA.Coders Academy, where I'm honing my skills in manual and automated testing of APIs and web applications using tools like Postman, Robot, Ruby, Cucumber, and Playwright.

Fun facts: I have a soft spot for all things nerdyâ€”be it Star Wars, Anime, or video games. ðŸŽ®

Feel free to reach out for a chat or collaboration. Let's code and explore the wonders of technology together!
